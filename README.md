[My Events - Countdown](https://github.com/Blakey47/Event-Countdown) is a beautifully simple Events app designed entirely to create wonderful looking moments that you can look forward to and remember. I've built this app with a combination of Storyboard and Programmatically, something I found incredibly fun. My Event - Countdown uses no libraries and build entirely using custom code.

The App is currently on the App Store and can be found [here](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/my-events-countdown/id1499349723?ls=1).
